in this project we tried to solve two different problems:
## detect horizon line in an image:
in some cases the satalite needs to know the orientention between itself and earth and he does it by detcting the horizon line and calculating the 
angle of the line compared to the satalite.
in the detect_horizon.py file we have function gets as an input image of earth(part of it) in space and as an output you get the two points that create the line 
of the horizon.
